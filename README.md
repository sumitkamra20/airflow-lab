## 🎯 Teaching Objectives

Students will learn how to use Apache Airflow to orchestrate data workflows on Snowflake, focusing on authentication, task dependencies, dynamic task generation, and notifications.

## 📑 Session Resources

- [Lab Guide](lab/lab-m1w4.md)
- [Solution Repository](solution/)
- [Technical Setup Guide](setup/)

## 🛠️ Pre-session Preparation

Docker and Python (3.9 and above) installed

## ⏱️ Session Timeline

Total Duration: 1.5 hours (plus 15min break)

```bash
T0:00 - T0:15 | TODO: Session Block 1 (15m)
T0:15 - T0:40 | TODO: Session Block 2 (25m)
T0:40 - T0:55 | Break (15m)
T0:55 - T1:15 | TODO: Session Block 3 (20m)
T1:15 - T1:45 | TODO: Session Block 4 (30m)
```

## 🔍 Key Teaching Points

Airflow Operator, TaskFlow API

Branch, sensors, bash

Dynamics Task

Notification, callbacks


## 📝 Assessment Points

This lab exercise consists of five tasks:

1. Airflow Variable: Authenticate with Snowflake - Use Airflow variables to store credentials and create a table.

2. Airflow Connection: Insert data using Airflow Connection - Shift to using Airflow’s built-in connection manager.

3. Airflow Sensor: Implement a sensor - Ensure data file is presented before parsing and inserting to table.

4. Notification: send a Discord message using webhool upon success (and failure) - Integrate notifications into the @dag API.

5. Dag design: Putting all tasks together and test run.
